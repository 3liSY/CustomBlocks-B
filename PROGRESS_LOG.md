## 2026-06-03 — Phase 1 CONFIRMED ✅ + Batch 2 (Phases 2-3 core)

### Context
- Developer asked to batch related phases (16 small steps was overwhelming) and to lower
  maxSlots to **800** for faster load. New plan = 6 testable batches; this is Batch 2.

### Done (build-verified, NOT yet in-game)
- Phase 1 confirmed working in-game ("Phase 1 works"). ✅
- `maxSlots` default → 800.
- `SlotDataStore` — atomic JSON persistence (sole slot disk-I/O class, rule #4).
- `SlotManager` — create/delete/rename/dupe + loadAll/saveAll/reload; orphan guard on load.
- `/cb` command tree: `CommandRegistrar` + `CreationCommands` (create/delete/rename/dupe)
  + `UtilityCommands` (list/give/reload). LANG1 avoided by construction (clean literal tree).
- Wired `CustomBlocksMod`: loadAll after registerAll, register commands, saveAll on stop.
- `gradlew build` PASSED, all gates green; no file over its size limit.

### Deferred (on purpose, to later batches)
- Undo/redo → batched with attributes (Batch 4 / Phase 6).
- retexture → needs the image pipeline (Batch 3 / Phase 4).
- Creative tab still lists all 800 slots; will switch to "only created blocks" in Batch 3.

### Next
- Developer in-game test of Batch 2 (TESTING_GUIDE §1c): create/list/give/place/rename/
  dupe/delete + survives a restart. Then Batch 3 = textures.

## 2026-06-03 — Phase 0 CONFIRMED ✅ + Phase 1 start

### Done
- **Phase 0 confirmed working in-game by the developer** ("Phase 0 works"). Mod loads in
  MC 1.21.1, the three `[CustomBlocks]` startup lines appear, no crash. Phase 0 is DONE.

### Now starting — Phase 1: Block Slot System
- Goal (Bible milestone): the game starts with **1028 blocks registered**, no errors.
- Scope: `CustomBlocksConfig` (minimal: maxSlots, httpPort), immutable `SlotData` + `.update()`,
  `SlotBlock`, `SlotManager` (register the pool + BlockItems + a creative tab), wire into
  `CustomBlocksMod` with a clear "Registered N slot blocks" log line.
- Deferred to their own phases: `SlotDataStore` (Phase 2 persistence), `BlockFinder` (Phase 3).
- Expectation: slot blocks render as the **missing-texture (purple/black) cube** until Phase 4.

### Build-verified (NOT yet in-game)
- Implemented `CustomBlocksConfig` (62 lines, atomic save), `SlotData` (immutable record
  + `.update()`), `SlotBlock` + `SlotBlock.SlotItem` (minimal), `SlotManager.registerAll()`,
  and wired `CustomBlocksMod` to register the pool + a "CustomBlocks" creative tab.
- `gradlew build` PASSED — compiles, all gates green. No file exceeds its size limit.
- Recycled the proven 1.21.1 registration API from the old project (`Identifier.of`,
  `Registry.register(Registries.BLOCK/ITEM, …)`, `FabricItemGroup.builder()`).
- **Awaiting developer in-game test** (see docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md §Phase 1): startup log
  should read "Registered 1028 slot blocks", game must not crash, creative tab present.
  Expect many "missing model" warnings + purple blocks — normal until Phase 4.

## 2026-06-03 (cont.) — Phase 0: hardening & protocol

### Done
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` — the operating protocol (golden rule, who the developer is, phase
  discipline, architecture rules, known pitfalls, git/doc protocol, forbidden behaviors).
- Added `verifyFileSize` build gate (§9.3): fails the build if any `.java` exceeds its
  limit (500 general / 400 command handlers / 300 `*Config.java`). package-info exempt.
  This is new — the old project relied on an unenforced rule and grew 9,400-line files.
- Added `.editorconfig` (UTF-8, LF, 4-space) for encoding/format consistency (NFR-11).
- Added GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): JDK 21 + `gradlew build`
  (which runs all three gates) + JAR artifact. Remote is `github.com/3liSY/CustomBlocks`.

### Note on "spot the bugs"
- The new project has no runtime bugs to hunt yet (≈3 code files, builds clean). The real
  bugs live in the old project; the strategy is **prevention** (gates above + the pitfalls
  table in CLAUDE.md §7) and **fix-on-port** as each phase is rebuilt.

### Verified
- `gradlew build` **PASSED** — all three gates run (`verifyFileSize`, `verifyMojibake`,
  `verifySound`).
- `verifyFileSize` proven to actually fire: a throwaway 501-line file made the build
  FAIL with exit 1 ("exceeds class limit of 500"); file then deleted, build green again.
  (A gate that's never seen to fail is false confidence — so it was tested both ways.)

### Next Session
- Phase 1 — Block Slot System (unchanged from the entry below).

## 2026-06-03 — Phase 0: Foundation (fresh start)

### Done
- Scaffolded a fresh project in the repo root, recycling the old project's working
  build infrastructure (Fabric Loom 1.7.4, Gradle 8.8 wrapper, MC 1.21.1, Java 21).
- `build.gradle`: minimal Phase-0 dependency set + `verifyMojibake` and `verifySound`
  gates wired into `build`. jcodec / SpotBugs / permissions are commented out, to be
  enabled in their phases (13 / 15 / when needed).
- `fabric.mod.json`, `customblocks.mixins.json` (empty mixin list), minimal `en_us.json`.
- Full package structure laid down as `package-info.java` for all 21 packages.
- `CustomBlocksMod` + `CustomBlocksClient` entrypoints — log a Hello-World line on load.
- Ported `TextSanitizer.java` verbatim (the mojibake repair dictionary).
- Docs: `CHANGELOG.md`, this log, `docs/adr/ADR-001` + template, copied
  `docs/MOJIBAKE_SHIELD.md`, and `LICENSE` / `LICENSE-ar`.

### Decision (flagged to developer)
- Instead of ~90 empty class stubs, the package structure is documented via
  `package-info.java` per package, with real classes added per phase. This matches
  the Bible's own "start minimal, expand per-phase" philosophy. Can switch to full
  stubs if the developer prefers.

### Verified
- `gradlew build` **PASSED** (25s): compileJava, verifyMojibake, and verifySound all
  green; produced `build/libs/customblocks-1.0.0.jar` (2.3 MB, fabric-api bundled).
- Required installing Temurin JDK 21 (machine had only JDK 26, too new for Gradle 8.8)
  and pinning the Gradle daemon to it via `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
- **NOT yet verified in-game** — per CLAUDE.md, only a developer in-game test counts
  as DONE. The build passing proves it compiles, not that it works in Minecraft.
  Next: run `gradlew runClient` and confirm the "[CustomBlocks] Hello World — mod
  loaded successfully." line appears in the log with no errors.

### Next Session
- Phase 1 — Block Slot System: `SlotBlock`, immutable `SlotData` + `.update()`,
  `SlotManager` (register 1028 blocks), `SlotDataStore`, `BlockFinder`, minimal
  `CustomBlocksConfig` (httpPort, maxSlots). Milestone: server starts with 1028
  blocks in the registry, no errors.
