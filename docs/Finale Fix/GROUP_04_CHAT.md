# Group 04 — Chat Messages & Command Communication

> **Prerequisite:** Group 02 (Chest GUI) verified in-game.
>
> **Objective:** Replace all terse/prefixed chat messages with human-readable, conversational output. Remove the `CB ` prefix style. Ensure error messages include plain-language explanations. Add DidYouMean typo correction and a structured `/cb help` chest GUI.
>
> **Source issues:** 17.2 (chat messages too terse), Q5 (DidYouMean + /cb help GUI), Group I decision (voice modes scrapped → single polished professional tone)
>
> **Rules:** Work through each test in order. Pay attention to message tone — "terse" is a failure even if functionally correct.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Message Tone Policy

All chat output from CustomBlocks follows one tone: **professional and conversational**. No robotic prefixes. No voice mode toggle.

Examples of correct style:

| Action | Old (terse) | New (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Create block | `CB  Created 'myblock'` | `Block "myblock" created successfully.` |
| Texture downloading | `CB  Downloading texture…` | `Downloading texture for "myblock"…` |
| Give item | `CB  Gave 1 ✓` | `Gave you 1 × MyBlock.` |
| Lock error | `'myblock' is locked` | `"myblock" is locked. Use /cb unlock myblock to edit it.` |
| Bad URL | `CB  Invalid URL` | `That URL doesn't point to an image. Check the link and try again.` |

### 2. Major Error Routing

When a major system error occurs (texture download failure, pack generation error, import failure, etc.):
- Send a clear explanation to the player who triggered the action.
- Simultaneously write the error to the Incidents log (Group 16) with full context.

This ensures server admins can review errors they didn't see in real time.

### 3. DidYouMean

When a player types an unknown `/cb` subcommand:
- Compute the closest matching known subcommand (Levenshtein distance or similar).
- If a close match is found, suggest it in chat.
- Config field: `didYouMean` — `smart` (default, only suggest when confident), `always`, `off`.

Example:
```
/cb cretae myblock
→ Unknown command "cretae". Did you mean: /cb create?
```

### 4. `/cb help` — Chest GUI

`/cb help` opens a chest GUI with paginated command reference:
- Organized by category: Block Management, Textures, Tools, Bulk, Export, etc.
- Each slot = one command group. Hover for description. Click to pre-fill command in chat.
- No more chat flood.

### 5. `/cb welcome`

`/cb welcome` shows a short welcome/quick-start message with clickable links to the most common first actions (create a block, open the GUI, etc.).

---

## Setup

```
/cb create g04a ChatTest
```

---

## Test G04.1 — Success message style (create)

```
/cb create g04b StyleTest
```

**Expected:** A friendly, complete-sentence confirmation. No `CB ` prefix. Something like:
`Block "g04b" ("StyleTest") created.`

**Pass:** Message is conversational, no terse prefix.
**Fail:** `CB  Created g04b` or similar old-style prefix format.

---

## Test G04.2 — Error message style (locked block)

```
/cb lock g04a
/cb setglow g04a 15
```

**Expected:** Error message like:
`"g04a" is locked. Use /cb unlock g04a to edit it.`

**Pass:** Error is a complete English sentence with a suggested action.
**Fail:** Terse one-liner like `'g04a' is locked`.

---

## Test G04.3 — Error message style (bad URL)

```
/cb retexture g04a https://definitely-not-a-valid-image-url.xyz/fake.abc
```

**Expected:** Clear explanation like:
`Could not download a texture from that URL. The link may be broken or doesn't point to an image.`

**Pass:** Human-readable explanation. No raw exception message.
**Fail:** Raw exception, terse code, or no message at all.

---

## Test G04.4 — Major error goes to Incidents log

After G04.3's failed retexture:

Open the Diagnostics/IT Chest (Group 16) and check the Incidents log.

**Expected:** The failed retexture attempt appears as an incident entry with timestamp, player name, action, and error detail.

**Pass:** Incident recorded in log.
**Fail:** Log is empty after the error.

---

## Test G04.5 — DidYouMean triggers on typo

```
/cb cretae g04a
```

**Expected:** Something like:
`Unknown command "cretae". Did you mean: /cb create?`

**Pass:** Suggestion appears in chat.
**Fail:** Generic "unknown command" with no suggestion.

---

## Test G04.6 — DidYouMean doesn't fire on garbage input

```
/cb xyzzy
```

**Expected:** No suggestion (too different from any real command). Message:
`Unknown command. Try /cb help for a list of commands.`

**Pass:** No spurious suggestion.
**Fail:** Suggests a completely unrelated command.

---

## Test G04.7 — DidYouMean can be disabled

Set `didYouMean = off` in config (or via Config chest GUI, Group 21).

```
/cb cretae g04a
```

**Expected:** No suggestion — just the unknown command message.

Restore `didYouMean = smart` after this test.

**Pass:** No suggestion when disabled.
**Fail:** Suggestion still appears despite config being off.

---

## Test G04.8 — `/cb help` opens chest GUI

```
/cb help
```

**Expected:** A chest GUI opens. Commands are organized by category. Each slot has a hover tooltip with description. No chat flood.

**Pass:** Chest GUI opens with organized command list.
**Fail:** Chat flooded with text, or command missing.

---

## Test G04.9 — `/cb help` slot click pre-fills chat

In the `/cb help` chest GUI, click any command slot (e.g., "create").

**Expected:** Chest GUI closes and the command is pre-filled in the chat input bar (e.g., `/cb create `).

**Pass:** Chat bar pre-filled with correct command prefix.
**Fail:** Nothing happens on click, or wrong command pre-filled.

---

## Test G04.10 — `/cb welcome`

```
/cb welcome
```

**Expected:** A short, friendly welcome message with clickable links for: "Create your first block", "Open the dashboard", "Browse help".

**Pass:** Message appears with working clickable links.
**Fail:** Command missing, or plain text with no clickable links.
